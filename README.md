# SeattleData AI & Security Speed Hackathon
## Multi-Agent System for Smart Traffic Management
## Project Overview
Urban traffic congestion leads to significant time loss, pollution, and fuel consumption. Static
traffic signals and traditional rule-based systems fail to optimize traffic flow dynamically.

## Challenge
Develop a multi-agent system where AI-powered traffic lights, smart vehicles, and drones
collaborate to manage real-time traffic, reducing congestion and improving emergency vehicle
response times.

## Goals
● Enable AI agents to analyze live traffic data and adjust signals dynamically.

● Implement vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for smarter routing.

● Simulate various urban traffic scenarios (rush hour, accidents, roadblocks).

● Ensure fairness in traffic distribution, preventing excessive delays in specific areas.


## Key Considerations
- Event-Driven Architecture: Emphasize the use of event-driven patterns to decouple agents and enable asynchronous communication. 
- State Preservation: Ensure that agents can maintain their state across events and resume processing from the last point. 
- Human-in-the-Loop: Design clear interfaces and workflows for human interaction and approval. 
- System Integration: Demonstrate how the multi-agent system can integrate with existing process systems. 
- Responsible AI: Consider ethical implications, fairness, and transparency in the design and implementation of the AI agents.
